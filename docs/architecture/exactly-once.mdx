# Exactly-Once Ask (Session-Scoped)

Kameo provides an optional, application-level exactly-once facility for remote `ask`.

It addresses the "lost ACK" failure mode:

- The receiver processes the request.
- The connection dies before the reply arrives.
- The client retries.

Without deduplication, the side effect may run twice.

## Mechanism

- Client generates a `RequestId` and sends `ExactlyOnce<M> { request_id, message }`.
- Receiver uses a per-actor in-memory cache to replay the original reply for duplicate request ids.
- `resolve_checked` uses a payload fingerprint to reject request-id reuse with different payloads.

See `docs/examples/remote-exactly-once-ask.mdx`.
