# Remote Links (Lifecycle, Signals, Socket Termination)

Kameo supports linking to other actors so a local actor can react when the linked actor becomes
available (link established) or becomes unavailable (link died).

For distributed actors, link death is typically driven by TCP/TLS socket termination.

## The Two Lifecycle Hooks

Actors can implement:

- `Actor::on_link_established(actor_ref, id)`
- `Actor::on_link_died(actor_ref, id, reason)`

These are delivered as mailbox signals (`Signal::LinkEstablished` and `Signal::LinkDied`).

## What Counts As "Remote Link Died"

With the `remote` feature, a peer socket disconnect triggers:

- `on_link_died(..., reason = ActorStopReason::PeerDisconnected)`

This is the main hook you use to:

- stop dependent work
- re-resolve a remote actor ref
- reconnect and resume

## Minimal Pattern: Link, Then React

High-level flow:

1. Do a remote `lookup()` to get a `DistributedActorRef`.
2. Call `remote_ref.link(&local_actor_ref)`.
3. Implement `on_link_established` and `on_link_died` on the local actor.
